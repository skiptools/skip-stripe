# SkipStripe

This is a free [Skip](https://skip.tools) Swift/Kotlin framework that 
contains integration with the Stripe SDK's 'Mobile Payment Element
for [iOS](https://docs.stripe.com/sdks/ios)
and [Android](https://docs.stripe.com/sdks/android).

### Usage

The API includes a `StripePaymentButton` which is created using a `StripePaymentConfiguration`.

For information on how to initialize the configuration object, see the Stripe documentation
for [iOS](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios&ui=payment-sheet)
and [Android](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=android&ui=payment-sheet).

The `SkiperStrip` sample app in this repository shows a complete Skip-to-native integration using:

- `skip-stripe/examples/PaymentSheetService.swift` – wrapper around Stripe's iOS payment sheet presenter.
- `skip-stripe/examples/StripePaymentService.swift` – shared service that creates payment intents, ephemeral keys, and SkipStripe configurations for Android.
- `skip-stripe/examples/ContentView.swift` – SwiftUI screen demonstrating both iOS and Android flows with `SimpleStripePaymentButton`.

```swift
import SkipStripe

struct PaymentButton: View {
    let paymentConfig = StripePaymentConfiguration(
        publishableKey: "PUBLISHABLE_KEY",
        merchantName: "Merchant, Inc.",
        customerID: "CUSTOMER_ID",
        ephemeralKeySecret: "EPHEMERAL_KEY_SECRET",
        clientSecret: "CLIENT_SECRET"
    )

    var body: some View {
        StripePaymentButton(configuration: paymentConfig, completion: paymentCompletion) {
            Text("Pay Now!")
        }
        .buttonStyle(.borderedProminent)
    }

    func paymentCompletion(result: StripePaymentResult) {
        switch result {
        case .completed:
            logger.log("Payment completed")
        case .canceled:
            logger.log("Payment canceled")
        case .failed(error: let error):
            logger.log("Payment error: \(error)")
        }
    }
}
```

## Building

This project is a free Swift Package Manager module that uses the
[Skip](https://skip.tools) plugin to transpile Swift into Kotlin.

Building the module requires that Skip be installed using
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) with `brew install skiptools/skip/skip`.
This will also install the necessary build prerequisites:
Kotlin, Gradle, and the Android build tools.

## Testing

The module can be tested using the standard `swift test` command
or by running the test target for the macOS destination in Xcode,
which will run the Swift tests as well as the transpiled
Kotlin JUnit tests in the Robolectric Android simulation environment.

Parity testing can be performed with `skip test`,
which will output a table of the test results for both platforms.
